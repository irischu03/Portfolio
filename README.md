[#Project 1: Airline Passenger Satisfaction Classification : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Classification/blob/main/README.md)

Customer satisfaction is always top of mind for airlines. Unhappy or disengaged customers mean fewer passengers and less revenue. It’s important that customers have an excellent experience every time they travel. On-time flights, good in-flight entertainment, more (and better) snacks, and more leg room might be the obvious contributors to a good experience and more loyalty.  While we might hear about those aspects the most, the customer experience is not about just the flight itself. It’s everything from purchasing the ticket on the company’s website or mobile app to checking bags in at the airport or via a mobile app to waiting in the terminal. Therefore, it is an interesting topic to investigate the relationship between customer’s attitude with some certain factors from satisfaction survey.
This project addresses the two questions that came up: 
1. What are the most important factors affecting customer’s satisfaction? 
2. Is it possible to predict customer’s satisfaction rate based on the information from survey?

[#Project 2: Grant Searching Automation : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Grant-Searching/blob/main/README.md)(Ongoing)

Researching grant prospects could be time-consuming and overwhelming. Our goal in this project is to develop an automation system so that our organization is able to find available grant opportunities and fill out applications with little or no human intervention.

1. Find suitable online grant opportunities using BeautifulSoup and selenium
2. Create and train NLP model for automation

[#Project 3: IMDB Reviews Analysis : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/IMDB-Reviews-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)

Using logistic regression in R to perform binary classification of IMDB moview reviews. To improve accuracy, I also test the impact of different thresholds for classification and plot ROC curve for visualization.

[#Project 4: Insurance Churn Analysis : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Insurance-Churn-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)

Insurance companies around the world operate in a very competitive environment. With various aspects of data collected from millions of customers, it is painstakingly hard to analyze and understand the reason for a customer’s decision to switch to a different insurance provider.
For an industry where customer acquisition and retention are equally important, and the former being a more expensive process, insurance companies rely on data to understand customer behavior to prevent retention. Thus knowing whether a customer is possibly going to switch beforehand gives insurance companies an opportunity to come up with strategies to prevent it from actually happening.

[#Project 5: Healthcare Classification Problem : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Healthcare-Classification-Problem/blob/main/README.md)

Recent Covid-19 Pandemic has raised alarms over one of the most overlooked area to focus: Healthcare Management. While healthcare management has various use cases for using data science, patient length of stay is one critical parameter to observe and predict if one wants to improve the efficiency of the healthcare management in a hospital.
My goal is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on case by case basis so that the Hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better functioning. 

[#Project 6: Housing Price Regression : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Housing-Price-Regression-Model/blob/main/README.md)

The project aims at building a linear model to predict the selling price using a set of potential predictor variables.
