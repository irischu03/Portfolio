[#Project 1: Grant Searching Automation : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Grant-Searching/blob/main/README.md)

Researching grant prospects could be time-consuming and overwhelming. Our goal in this project is to develop an automation system so that our organization is able to find available grant opportunities and fill out applications with little or no human intervention.

1. Find suitable online grant opportunities using BeautifulSoup and selenium
2. Create and train NLP model for automation

[#Project 3: Healthcare Classification Problem : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Healthcare-Classification-Problem/blob/main/README.md)

Recent Covid-19 Pandemic has raised alarms over one of the most overlooked area to focus: Healthcare Management. While healthcare management has various use cases for using data science, patient length of stay is one critical parameter to observe and predict if one wants to improve the efficiency of the healthcare management in a hospital.
My goal is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on case by case basis so that the Hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better functioning. 

[#Project 4: Housing Price Regression : Project Overview](https://github.com/irischu03/Housing-Price-Regression-Model/blob/main/README.md)
