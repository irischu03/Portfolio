#Project 1: Grant Searching Automation : Project Overview
Researching grant prospects could be time-consuming and overwhelming. Our goal in this project is to develop an automation system so that our organization is able to find available grant opportunities and fill out applications with little or no human intervention.

1. Find suitable online grant opportunities using BeautifulSoup and selenium
2. Create autofill scripts to fill in constant values
